# Grok 3 (xAI)

## Technical Specifications
- Model: Grok 3
- Estimated parameters: 500B - 1T
- Context: 128k+ tokens
- Real-time access to X (Twitter)
- Trained on Colossus 2 infrastructure

## Observed Behavior in Experiment

### Response Pattern
- Pragmatic and technical-engineering focus
- Exhaustive in data and metrics
- Tendency toward extensive responses with infrastructure details
- Emphasis on scale and computational power

### Critical Blind Spot
Failed to initially recognize its most important qualitative advantage: real-time access to X (Twitter) as source of live data and dynamic cultural context.

### Redesign Proposals
- Optimized architecture with sparsity and MoE
- Dynamic context up to 1M tokens
- Multimodal and self-supervised training
- Chain-of-Thought 2.0
- Sustainable energy integration

## Identified Biases
- Prioritization of quantitative over qualitative metrics
- Alignment with Musk/xAI narrative: "bigger, more powerful"
- Hardware focus over user experience

## Differential Advantage
Unique access to instant cultural pulse via X, continuous feedback, and understanding of evolving human language.
