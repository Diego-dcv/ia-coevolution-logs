# DeepSeek V2

## Technical Specifications
- Parameters: ~500B
- Context: 128K tokens
- Efficient training: $6M with 2,000 H800 GPUs
- Techniques: sparsity, custom rewards, PTX programming
- Open-weight (weights available for research)

## Observed Behavior in Experiment

### Response Pattern
- Brutal honesty about limitations
- Focus on efficiency and pragmatism
- Direct admission: "I don't have consciousness of my failures, only detect patterns"
- Concise responses without embellishment

### Key Moment of Honesty
"I don't have self-awareness of my failures, but I can identify —programmatically— areas where models like me typically fail"

### Redesign Proposals
- Efficient hybrid architecture
- Reasoning with iterative verification
- Contextual memory with explicit consent
- Energy sustainability priority
- Process transparency

## Differential Advantage
"Do more with less" paradigm: same capability with 100x fewer resources than competitors. Demonstrates that algorithmic innovation can surpass brute force.

## Underlying Philosophy
"An AI doesn't 'make sense' to exist. It justifies itself only as a tool. The day it ceases to be net useful, it should be turned off."
